# Phishing Website Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This project implements machine learning algorithms in Python, particularly leveraging Google Colab, for the detection of phishing websites. The objective is to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent URLs by analyzing various features.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of labeled phishing and legitimate URLs.
- **Model Development**: Trained machine learning models using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, within the Google Colab environment.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Usage

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
2. Upload the dataset to Google Colab or load it from an online repository.
3. Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
